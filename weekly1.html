    <p class="weekly">In the academic environment, science and art are rarely seen as complementary. To those in engaging in scientific discourse, the methods by which experiments are conducted must be free of difference and completed solely based on previously agreed upon practices. To those involved with the arts, the rigidity of the sciences is seen as a hindrance to the creative process and is strongly discouraged. If there is a middle ground between the two disciplines, it exists in the pieces created by Japanese artist Shusaku Arakawa.
<br> Arakawa held a unique position when it came to the relationship between the arts and the sciences: “If you want to become an artist, you have to become a scientist first” (Whittle). What the many pieces that make up “The Mechanism of Meaning” show is the value of looking at the art in the science - the beauty that exists in the construction of our subjective perception of the world, and showcasing that perspective through artistic expression.
<br>	Arakawa’s pieces show, using art, realities about the human sciences that cannot be interpreted through mere scientific discourse. Indeed, great meaning is communicated through scientific work, but art offers us the opportunity to explore themes and communicate ideas that break free of the practical restraints of science. I point to the piece titled The Energy of Meaning to explore this idea. In it, Arakawa illustrated the density of the connections of words in our minds. This creative diagram practically shows the relationships between the words through physical connections between lines, but it is the intersection of these lines and the mass that is created that communicates the complexity of the matter at hand, and reinforcing the beautiful mess that is our human perception.
