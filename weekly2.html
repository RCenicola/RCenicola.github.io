    <h2> Weekly 2</h2>
    <p class="weekly">All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace introduces us to Ayn Rand, a very unique individual who pioneered movements centered around objectivism. Objectivism is based around the idea that human beings are alone in the universe, and that only by freeing themselves of political and social control and living only by selfish desires can we truly become the best version of ourselves and our world. The documentary follows a number of individuals involved with California’s tech capitol, Silicon Valley, and their admiration for Rand’s work. By doing so, the film makes the case that many of the greatest computing technologies and ideologies have sprung up from the desire of achieving total individual human autonomy with computers facilitating the balance needed within the system.
<br>	I think it is clear that we have already become a cyborg-society, in which computers are inseparable from the actions within our daily lives. Yet I struggle to see a future in which computers lead to the elimination of human cooperation, and the evidence is in the technologies we have created. An incredible amount of the computing technology we generate has to do with communication - most notably in our day and age, social media. Social media has drastically changed the way human interact within the last ten years, and is redefining ways which humans engage with our world politically and socially. In many ways, computers have aided us in an opposite direction - one in which every human on earth has access to be able to contribute to a greater system for the sake of human interaction. It is built into our DNA to want to interact, and the platforms we have created reflect this desire.
