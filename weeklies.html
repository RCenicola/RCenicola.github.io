        <p>In the academic environment, science and art are rarely seen as complementary. To those in engaging in scientific discourse, the methods by which experiments are conducted must be free of difference and completed solely based on previously agreed upon practices. To those involved with the arts, the rigidity of the sciences is seen as a hindrance to the creative process and is strongly discouraged. If there is a middle ground between the two disciplines, it exists in the pieces created by Japanese artist Shusaku Arakawa. </p>
	       <p>Arakawa held a unique position when it came to the relationship between the arts and the sciences: “If you want to become an artist, you have to become a scientist first” (Whittle). What the many pieces that make up “The Mechanism of Meaning” show is the value of looking at the art in the science - the beauty that exists in the construction of our subjective perception of the world, and showcasing that perspective through artistic expression. </p>
         <p>	Arakawa’s pieces show, using art, realities about the human sciences that cannot be interpreted through mere scientific discourse. Indeed, great meaning is communicated through scientific work, but art offers us the opportunity to explore themes and communicate ideas that break free of the practical restraints of science. I point to the piece titled The Energy of Meaning to explore this idea. In it, Arakawa illustrated the density of the connections of words in our minds. This creative diagram practically shows the relationships between the words through physical connections between lines, but it is the intersection of these lines and the mass that is created that communicates the complexity of the matter at hand, and reinforcing the beautiful mess that is our human perception.

        <p>All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace introduces us to Ayn Rand, a very unique individual who pioneered movements centered around objectivism. Objectivism is based around the idea that human beings are alone in the universe, and that only by freeing themselves of political and social control and living only by selfish desires can we truly become the best version of ourselves and our world. The documentary follows a number of individuals involved with California’s tech capitol, Silicon Valley, and their admiration for Rand’s work. By doing so, the film makes the case that many of the greatest computing technologies and ideologies have sprung up from the desire of achieving total individual human autonomy with computers facilitating the balance needed within the system. </p>
	      <p>I think it is clear that we have already become a cyborg-society, in which computers are inseparable from the actions within our daily lives. Yet I struggle to see a future in which computers lead to the elimination of human cooperation, and the evidence is in the technologies we have created. An incredible amount of the computing technology we generate has to do with communication - most notably in our day and age, social media. Social media has drastically changed the way human interact within the last ten years, and is redefining ways which humans engage with our world politically and socially. In many ways, computers have aided us in an opposite direction - one in which every human on earth has access to be able to contribute to a greater system for the sake of human interaction. It is built into our DNA to want to interact, and the platforms we have created reflect this desire.</p>

        <p>Through In Defense of the Poor Image, Hito Steyerl takes a deep look at the phenomena of the “poor image” and its role as a political agent in our modern digital culture. In looking to define the characteristics of the poor image, Steyerl looks not to merely at aesthetic qualities but the idea of an image as a signifier of class and privilege and how digital technologies have disrupted the ideas of high-resolution and low-resolution images. Steyerl argues that visual avant-garde art, once removed from the public sphere and sheltered off into elitist communities and pr ivate screenings, has been forced into the digital ecosystem through piracy and decentralized sharing and “resurrected” as poor images. </p>
	         <p>To Steyerl, speed and velocity play a major role in defining how the the poor image functions politically. She argues that poor images are poor because they are compressed and travel quickly, losing their matter as they gain speed. In this process, images that were initially created against the “fetish value of high resolution” are removed from their original context, rapidly adapted over and over again, and integrated back into the popular crowd. While losing its original substance, the new aura of the image is not based on its original intended purpose, but the power of a shared visual language that is developed through this process of rapid sharing. In this, communities that were once barred from interacting in elite communities are now more involved in the artistic process, and are able to share their experiences through a common language.</p>

    <h3 id="W4">Weekly 4</h3>
    <p>Through his multitude of combine and collage pieces, Rauschenberg worked to explore the role of the artist and to challenge the boundaries of modern art. His unique approach to collage is just one of the many novel steps he took in commenting on the role of imagery and materialization within art. Before his works, traditional collage images were simply a mapping of an image, a translation from its three-dimensional form in reality into a two-dimensional version bound by the qualities of the medium upon which it is transferred. This translation resulted in a change in scale and texture, and leaving much of its original state out of the equation.</p>
      <p>Yet Rauschenberg’s collages challenged this by offering a new approach - instead of a simple translation of an object, he conducted a relocation. His method involved removing the object from the space of the world and “installing it in a space of an entirely different order”. Through stripping it of its form in reality, the images were understood to transcend reality, maintaining its true form in a different world. Rauschenberg works to comment on the materiality of images by embedding seemingly devalued objects within a new space and suspending them within this new world through various techniques including putting a coat of paint or a translucent scrim over the materials. In doing this, each object within the piece carries its own equal weight and conveys the meaning which the viewer projects onto it based on their relationship with the image in the real world.</p>
        <p>It is interesting to explore how Rauschenberg’s commentary on the materiality of images plays out within our modern digital world, particularly with the internet. It could be argued that Rauschenberg’s “relocation” technique is used constantly on the internet, where images and data are seemingly fluid objects constantly being inserted into new worlds and contexts and retaining their unique materiality. Yet as argued in Hito Steyerl’s In Defense of the Poor Image, these images must withstand immense speed that the internet has to offer, and through each relocation face the reality of being translated into new forms and possibly changing the meaning behind their materiality. </p>

    <h3 id="W5">Weekly 5</h3>
    <p>There is no denying that the ideas surrounding cybernetics are quite enticing - who wouldn’t want to live in a world free of power struggles, politics, and wars? How wonderful would it be if individuals could strip away our egos and selfish desires and instead view ourselves as a small node within a larger system, doing our part to keep it in constant balance? It seems so simple and so pure - all aspects of our world functioning as individual actors, reacting to feedback, and transmitting energy from one node to another. I must admit that I was a complete believer in a world governed by cybernetics after reading Wiener’s book in my IML 499 class sophomore year. I was convinced that the functions behind machines held the key to explaining our own functioning, distilling my own biology down to 1s and 0s and seeing the world much more mechanically. The theory felt so attractive in its minimalism and its end-goal of maintaining a state of balance, a goal that I had set forth in my life as well. Yet as detailed in this documentary and as experienced in my own life, the theory leaves almost no room for the variation and complexity that comes with being human. </p>
      <p>Just as this episode alluded to in its description of the Odum brothers, I believe cybernetics serves much better as a metaphor than as a definitive set of principles to describe reality. What cybernetics loses in its minimalism is the beauty of individual human experience, the diversity that comes along with each human’s lived journey. Out of the billions of people that live on this earth, no one has experienced the same life, has shared the same thoughts, or has followed the same desires. Cybernetics ignores the reality of our human condition and the condition of the natural world - as systematic as it may seem, it is still a wild and untamed beast unable to be predicted. And in ignoring this reality, it loses the art in life in exchange for strict objectivity. In no life would I want to live in a world stripped of its art.</p>

    <h3 id="W6">Weekly 6</h3>
    <p>After completing a report on Foucault and his infamous work Discipline and Punish a year ago, his theories have become central to my work in MA+P as well as my understanding of the world. This podcast does a great job of unpacking an extremely dense subject that makes a number of bold claims about the very fabric of our societies and how they function properly. While there are dozens of topics I can stem from and comment on, I want to take this opportunity to consider the escape plan - how can this system be fixed? Diving further, Foucault depicts this system as an inherently evil mechanism to control the populous of a sovereign nation, but is this system inherently evil, or can it be used for good? </p>
<p>Many would argue that knowledge and education is the way to fix this system. However, each day we see those that are most aware of this sinister power structure, those who fight against it, are the ones who are punished and swept out of the public eye. They are arrested for some vague reason such as “disorderly conduct”, and are sent to a jail cell while they await their trial, which is postponed for months on end until they are eventually forgotten. So, is the only way out upwards? As the podcast describes, is the way out to become the executive who evades taxes but is in the position to define what a “good citizen” is? There is no way for everyone to hold this position, and we know of the disadvantages many citizens face when trying to achieve this position. For someone to be in power, there need to be prisoners who are kept in check.</p>
<p>In its conclusion, the podcast eludes to a dramatic changing of the times in which our understanding of what it is to be a human being will reach an expiration date. I believe it is in this transformation that a change in this broken system will come about - our transition into the posthuman era. The rise of digital technologies is shifting the human experience - no longer are we beings using technology, but we are beings intertwined with our technological and digital selves, in which the digital world is almost inseparable from the very fabric of our societies. It is in this transition that a crack in the modern systems of power will emerge, and an opportunity to engage will arise. </p>

    <h3 id="W7">Weekly 7</h3>
    <p>It is fascinating to consider what fragments of my digital self I have left scattered across the internet during my life. From accounts and characters made on Disney online gaming sites, to social apps like Vine that were once so prominent in my life and have since faded away, it is interesting to consider just how much a person could learn about myself from examining these “selves”. I believe Deleuze is arguing for another way of considering how these personal digital archives function, not as fragments of a whole self, but instead as individual whole pieces of a self scattered across a network - the dividual. </p>
	<p>Before we began engaging with the web numerous times a day, our identity was bound to our bodies, our “selfs”. We considered our identity as a bound set of characteristics, memories, and traits that were inseparable from our real lived existence and defined our lives. Yet daily interaction with the web has scattered our identity into countless “data packages” across the internet. These traces can contain a crazy amount of information about us, from the ways we interact with web interfaces, how long we typically engage with certain types of content, and even where we are at all times during the day. In this work Deleuze contemplates how Foucault's ideas of internalized power function in a society where identities are severed into these dividuals. While Foucault’s ideas suggest that institutions physically place people within time and space to control them, Deleuze argues that these fragmented traces of our selves left on the web can be leveraged to scrutinize our interactions, and therefore implore us to act in a certain way. It can be argued that powerful institutions have more access to us than ever before, and more entry points from which to surveil our actions. </p>

    <h3 id="W8">Weekly 8</h3>
    <p>Through “All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace”, the filmmakers explored the relationship between Cybernetics and the development of the theory of the ecosystem, where they argued that the Odum brothers were wrong to use the theories behind Cybernetics as a strict framework to define ecological principles because it left no room for the natural variation that exists in untamed nature. Through his works, I believe Pierre Huyghe works to expand on this critique by using imaginative art to create spaces that are precisely systematic, yet also wildly unpredictable. This is shown prominently in his work After ALife Ahead, in which Pierre created an expansive and complex “living organism” within the belly of a worn down ice rink. The entire space is controlled via temperature and humidity sensors - much like the electronic models of ecosystems created by the Odum brothers, these sensors act based on the feedback they receive about the environment, which creates another actionable trigger for another sensor, and so on.</p>
	<p>Yet Huyghe is not just interested in creating dynamic and reactive environments, but allowing an unpredictable actor to define the ways that the system transforms. In this case, everything about the space is working to create the ideal conditions for human cancer cells to divide and multiply. The feedback mechanisms are in a constant battle to try and achieve a well-balanced state for the cells to grow healthily, almost allowing the cells themselves (and their unpredictability in growth) to decide how the system functions. In this way, the fragmented aspects of the piece are related to one another, and come together to create an augmented ecosystem, driven by an unpredictable agent. This fascinating take on systems thinking integrates a number of seemingly separate aspects of our world - computing technology, human cells, animals, and natural energies such as sunlight - and highlights their singular importance in ensuring the ecosystem functions properly. </p>

      <h3 id="W9">Weekly 9</h3>
      <p>Lyotard’s work begins with a rather bleak and violent monologue describing the end of the world and the obliteration of all sophisticated human thought. Quite the introduction. But what seems to be a rather hopeless depiction of an exploded universe in which “the sun, our earth, and...thought will have been no more than a spasmodic state of energy, an instant of established order, a smile on the surface of matter in a remote corner of the cosmos” is really a stepping stone leading to his primary question - in what way does the human body function in relation to thought, and is it necessary in order for thought to exist? </p>
	<p>Lyotard continues with a rather interesting depiction of the relationship between the body and human thought, one where the body is considered the “hardware” of the device that is “thought”. I have always been fascinated with the study of perception, and the possible existence of dimensions within our world that are seemingly imperceivable by humans because we lack the “hardware” to properly process and sense them. I believe Lyotard’s arguments dig into this question, exploring how the specific “software” that humans are endowed with influence the ways in which we perceive the world, and therefore generate human thought. Based on his analysis, I believe the proper question is not “can thought go on without a body”, but rather, “what does human thought look like without a body”? Human thought is a very specific category of the device of thought. While it may be impossible for us to know how thought may function in a being that does not share our same bodies, it is interesting to ask how we can mimic human thought without the specific hardware of the human body. In a future where we may have the ability to upload thought and consciousness onto a universal collective server, how do we ensure thought remains in the confines of the human experience? Or even better, would we even desire thought to act in a similar way, or one that is able to perceive far more than our bodies can? </p>
